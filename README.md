# Pacman Happy Birthday

This is a goofy little DOS program I wrote for Diana in the late Paleolithic era. Thanks to the magic of [JS-DOS](http://js-dos.com/), we can all now relive the glory of hand-rolled VGA Mode X assembly.

## Running It

    $> npm install
    $> npm start

That seems to be it.
